# View fundamentals

Define the visual elements of your website using a hierarchy of views.

Views are the building blocks that you use to declare your website. Each view
contains a description of what to display. Every bit of your website thatâ€™s
visible to the user derives from the description in a view, and any type that
conforms to the ``View`` protocol can act as a view in your website.
