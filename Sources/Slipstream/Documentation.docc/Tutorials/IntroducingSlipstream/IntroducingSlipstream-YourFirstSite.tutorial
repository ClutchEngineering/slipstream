  @Intro(title: "Setting up your workspace") {
    This tutorial guides you through building a website for coco the pig. Youâ€™ll start by
    setting up your workspace by installing Tailwind CSS and creating the Swift package you'll
    use to generate your website. By the end of this tutorial you will have deployed your first
    static Slipstream site to the internet for free using GitHub Pages.

      Slipstream requires a Mac with Xcode and Tailwind CSS installed. In this section we'll also
      create a new Swift Package for our website and configure it to work with Slipstream and
      Tailwind CSS.

      @Step {
        Install Xcode from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or
        from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Xcode 15 or higher is required.

      }

      @Step {
        Open Xcode and create a Package. Select the macOS Executable template and click Next. Name
        your site and enable the "Create git repository" option so that we can push the site to
        GitHub later on.

      }

      @Step {
        Open Terminal and install Tailwind CSS. Alternatively, follow the installation instructions
        at [tailwindcss.com/docs/installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

        @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-1-3.sh")
      }

      @Step {
        In the same terminal, change your working directory to your newly created site and
        initialize Tailwind CSS. This will create a generic tailwind.config.js file for your site.

        @Code(name: "Terminal", file: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-1-4.sh", reset: true)
      }

      @Step {
        Back in Xcode, verify that your tailwind.config has now appeared.
        
        You now have all the prerequisites to make your first Slipstream site!
