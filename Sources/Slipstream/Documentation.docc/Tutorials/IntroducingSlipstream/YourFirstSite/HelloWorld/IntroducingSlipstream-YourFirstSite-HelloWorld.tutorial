    Learn the essential Slipstream concepts and workflow to build your first site.

    This tutorial assumes you already have Xcode and Tailwind CSS installed and that you have a
    Swift package with Slipstream added as a dependency.

      Let's learn the basics of Slipstream. If you're familiar with SwiftUI then this section will
      also feel familiar.

    }
    
    @Steps {
      @Step {
        Like SwiftUI, every project in Slipstream starts with a ``View``.
        
        Open up main.swift.

        @Code(name: "main.swift", file: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-1-1.swift")
      }

      @Step {
        Remove the boilerplate and add a new ``View`` type called `Home`.
        
        This view will be the root definition for our home page.
        
        @Code(name: "main.swift", file: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-1-2.swift")
      }

      @Step {
        Now let's try rendering the view to see what the output looks like. We'll use
        ``renderHTML(_:)`` to render our view to a string that we can print to the console.
        
        Notice that the output includes our text wrapped inside of a `<p>` element. Every View type
        in Slipstream will produce some kind of an HTML element. When possible, Slipstream tries to
        match the generated code to similar behavior for the view's SwiftUI equivalent.
        <doc:SlipstreamforSwiftUIDevelopers> provides a complete outline of the overlap between
        SwiftUI and Slipstream.

        @Code(name: "main.swift", file: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-1-3.swift") {
          @Image(source: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-1-3-preview", alt: "The output from rendering our view: <p>Hello, world!</p>")
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  @Section(title: "Rendering to disk") {
    @ContentAndMedia {
      Now that we've made our first Slipstream view, let's get it saved to disk so that we can
      preview the output to a browser.

      @Image(source: "logo-square", alt: "The Slipstream logo. The Swift bird logo is flying off the edge of the Tailwind CSS wind logo")
    }

    @Steps {
      @Step {
        Slipstream provides a barebones site renderer that requires we define a ``Sitemap``, essentially
        a map of filepaths to ``View`` instances.

        To use it we first define our sitemap.
        
        @Code(name: "main.swift", file: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-2-1.swift", previousFile: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-1-3.swift")
      }

      @Step {
        Next we need to define where we want to output our site to. In most cases just writing to
        your project directory is going to be sufficient, but you could extend functionality with
        more options if needed.

        @Code(name: "main.swift", file: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-2-2.swift")
      }

      @Step {
        We can now use ``renderSitemap(_:to:encoding:)`` to output our generated site to our project
        folder.

        @Code(name: "main.swift", file: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-2-3.swift") {
          @Image(source: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-2-3-preview", alt: "The output from rendering our sitemap")
        }
      }

      @Step {
        Congratulations! You've just generated your first Slipstream html page! ðŸŽ‰ It ain't pretty
        (yet!), but it's yours ðŸ˜‰

        You can try previewing `index.html` by right clicking it in Xcode and clicking "Open
        with External Editor".

        @Image(source: "IntroducingSlipstream-YourFirstSite-HelloWorld-2-4", alt: "The output from rendering our sitemap")
      }
    }
  }
}
